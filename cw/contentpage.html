		i.e., "sacred footprint", a 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) rock formation near the summit, which in Buddhist tradition is held to be the footprint of 
		the Buddha, in Hindu tradition that of Hanuman or Shiva (Tamil: சிவனொளிபாதமலை, lit. 'Sivanolipaathamalai'), i.e., "Mountain of Shiva's Light",
		and in some Islamic and Christian traditions that of Adam, or that of St. Thomas.</p>
